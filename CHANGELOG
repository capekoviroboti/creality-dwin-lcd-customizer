# 1.0.0-alpha

* First Alpha release! Same pre-release cautions apply, but the tools are working well on macOS and Linux. They should be able to build display firemware reliably for Ender 3 V2s, Voxelab Aquilas and Voxelab Aquila X2s. The DWIN_SET directories produced for other printers have not been tested and are entirely experimental at this stage.


# 0.01

* Pre-release. Everything is changing very rapidly; don't depend on anything working or staying stable.
